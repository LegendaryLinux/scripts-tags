**Lesson 3: Sectioning**

In this lesson we will cover three tags which help you do divide your webpage into
sections.

Tags we will be covering, from smallest to largest content:
* `<div>`
* `<p>`
* `<span>`

`<div>` is a divider tag. It is intended to divide sections of your webpage
into more manageable segments. Typically a `<div>` will contain many other tags
and elements. This tag automatically appends a `\n` after itself.

`<p>` is the paragraph tag. This is intended to separate paragraphs of text, and
is often used as a smaller type of `<div>`. This tag automatically appends a `\n`
after itself.

`<span>` is the smallest type of separator. In fact, it has no impact in your page
unless given a purpose through Javascript or CSS. Unlike `<div>` and `<p>`,
`<span>` will not append a newline to your page.
