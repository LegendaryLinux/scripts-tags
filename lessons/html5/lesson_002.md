**Lesson 2: Text Formatting**

In the previous lesson, you learned how to make the smallest possible HTML5 page. In this lesson,
we'll be going over how to do some very basic formatting.

Tags we will talk about:
* Comments (`<!-- Comments -->`)
* Break-Line (`<br/>`)
* Headers (`<h1>` - `<h6>`)
* Small (`<small>`)
* Bold / Strong (`<b>` / `<strong>`)
* Italics / Emphasize (`<i>` / `<em>`)
* Underline (`<u>`)
* Superscript (`<sup>`)
* Subscript (`<sub>`)

A note on the difference between `<b>`, `<strong>`, `<i>`, and `<em>`:  
In nearly all cases they have the same effect on text in a web browser, but they are not the same.  
`<b>` and `<i>` represent a style of text, while `<strong>` and `<em>` are designed to indicate the
way in which something should be understood. For example: a text to speech program would not behave any
differently for an `<i>` tag, but would likely alter the tone of speech for an `<em>` tag.
