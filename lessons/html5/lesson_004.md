**Lesson 4: Tables**

Seven tags.

Tables are a good way to efficiently organize groups of related data. If you've ever seen  
an Excel spreadsheet, you know what a table looks like.

`<table>` is a container tag, and as such has an opening and closing tag
  
`<thead>`,`<tbody>`,`<tfoot>` are category tags, which allow you to assign style to groups  
of rows in your table. Alone, they have no impact on your cell content.

`<tr>` defines a ***table row***

`<th>` and `<td>` define table cells. Each row must have an equal number of cells.

* `<table>`
* `<thead>`
* `<tbody>`
* `<tr>`
* `<th>`
* `<td>`
* `<tfoot>`
